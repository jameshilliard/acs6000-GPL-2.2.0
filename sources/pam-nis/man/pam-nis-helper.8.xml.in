      <p>
	A  helper  binary  for the pam_nis module, pam-nis-helper, is provided to
	check the user's password. This binary is very simple and
	will only check the password of the user  invoking  it.  It  is  called
	transparently  on behalf of the user by the authenticating component of
	the pam_nis module. In this way it is possible for  applications
	to work without being setuid root.

    <section name="usage">
      <p>
	This  program  is  not intended to be called directly by users and will
	log to syslog if it is called improperly (i.e., by  someone  trying  to
	exploit it).
